      "abstract": "Poems about paintings force the reader to attend tal of suffering in all three paintings: verbals and clauses which serve as qualifiers contribute to a stilling of motion and a detachment from prior action appropriate not only to the pictorial scenes behind the poem but to the interpretation of those scenes as well. Thus a critical analysis of the meaning of the poem must begin with a proper reading of these syntactic and anaphoric patterns to the paintings alluded to in the title.",

      "abstract": "People directly experience only themselves here and now but often consider, evaluate, and plan situations that are removed in time or space, that pertain to others' experiences, and that are hypothetical rather than real. People thus transcend the present and mentally traverse temporal distance, spatial distance, social distance, and hypotheticality. We argue that this is made possible by the human capacity for abstract processing of information. We review research showing that there is considerable similarity in the way people mentally traverse different distances, that the process of abstraction underlies traversing different distances, and that this process guides the way people predict, evaluate, and plan near and distant situations.",
