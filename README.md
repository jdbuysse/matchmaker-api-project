Goal: use JSTOR labs' matchmaker API to query each line of a selected poem to generate links to criticism
also create a handy visual API tool for people to run their own queries

Technologies:
    React w/ hooks
    async lifecycle stuff for running queries and displaying loadbar
    some clever rendering stuff because the API calls are significant
